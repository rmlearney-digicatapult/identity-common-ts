## 0.6.0

### Patch Changes

- 2a28c82: Reject a pushed authorization request or interactive authorization request containing a `request_uri` parameter with an `invalid_request` error, instead of fetching the `request_uri`.
- 28fb188: Return the `unknown_credential_configuration` error (OpenID4VCI 1.0 §8.3.1) when a credential request references a `credential_configuration_id` that is not in the issuer's `credential_configurations_supported`. Previously `parseCredentialRequest` threw a generic `Oauth2Error` and `Openid4vciIssuer.parseCredentialRequest` reported it as `invalid_credential_request`.

## 0.5.6

### Patch Changes

- edfc2b5: Move the `@openid4vc/*` packages from the `oid4vc-ts` repository into `identity-common-ts`. The `@openid4vc/*` packages keep being versioned together, separately from the other packages in this repository.
  
  The packages stay ESM-only. Type declarations are now exposed through the `types` export condition, and `main` points to the ESM build. `require('@openid4vc/oauth2')` loads the ESM build, which needs a Node.js version that supports `require(esm)` (Node.js 20.19 and later, or 22.12 and later).
  
  The builds no longer include copies of code from other `@openid4vc/*` packages. `@openid4vc/oauth2` bundled its own copy of `ValidationError`, so `instanceof ValidationError` checks against the class exported by `@openid4vc/utils` failed for some errors thrown by `@openid4vc/oauth2`. `@openid4vc/openid4vci` and `@openid4vc/openid4vp` bundled copies of `zOauth2ErrorResponse` and `addSecondsToDate`. `@openid4vc/oauth2` now exports the `VerifyClientAttestationOptions` type.

## 0.5.5

### Patch Changes

- 6060c2d: Add `getAuthorizationServerMetadata` and `getJwks` callbacks to the `CallbackContext`, allowing authorization server metadata and JWK Sets to be resolved without performing a request.
  
  This makes it possible to avoid network requests for metadata and keys that the caller already has (for example an authorization server hosted by the same application, which would otherwise result in an HTTP request to itself when verifying an access token it issued), and to serve metadata and keys from a cache.
  
  Both callbacks are optional. If not provided, or if they return `undefined`, the metadata and JWK Sets are fetched over HTTP as before. `getAuthorizationServerMetadata` can additionally return `null` to indicate the metadata definitively does not exist, so it is not requested again.
  
  Values returned by the callbacks are validated exactly like fetched values: a JWK Set is parsed with the JWK Set schema, and authorization server metadata is parsed with the authorization server metadata schema and must have an `issuer` matching the requested issuer.
  
  The second parameter of the exported `fetchJwks` and `fetchAuthorizationServerMetadata` functions now also accepts an object with `fetch` and the matching resolve callback, in addition to the `Fetch` implementation it accepted before.

## 0.5.3

### Patch Changes

- 9c4c66c: Add support for di_vp proofs in credential requests
- Updated dependencies [9c4c66c]
- Updated dependencies [6886ca5]
  - @openid4vc/oauth2@0.5.3
  - @openid4vc/utils@0.5.3

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 78cdbca: Bring key attestations in line with the OpenID4VCI 1.0/1.1 key attestation format.

  - Emit `key-attestation+jwt` as the `typ` when creating a key attestation (previously the pre-final `keyattestation+jwt`). Verification still accepts the legacy value.
  - Fix an inverted validation that rejected a JWT header carrying both `trust_chain` and `kid`; the spec requires `kid` to be present when `trust_chain` is used for signature verification (fixed for both the key attestation and the `jwt` proof type headers).
  - Require `attested_keys` (and, when present, `key_storage`/`user_authentication`) to be non-empty arrays.
  - Make the `nonce` claim optional at the schema level; it is only required when the Credential Issuer has a Nonce Endpoint, which is enforced via `expectedNonce` during verification.

- fe01c0d: Fix credential response check to match spec definition
- Updated dependencies [33adaf0]
  - @openid4vc/oauth2@0.5.2
  - @openid4vc/utils@0.5.2

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 375b422: fix: legacy fallback to extracting authorization server metadata from issuer metadata. This broke with making grant_types_suppoted required. To not introduce a breaking change, we now assume the issuer only supports pre-auth flow if the authorization server metadata is in the issuer metadata. This legacy behavior will be removed once support for pre v1.0 oid4vci draft versions will be removed
  - @openid4vc/oauth2@0.5.1
  - @openid4vc/utils@0.5.1

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- fa29ab6: chore: drop node 18 support. Lowest supported Node.JS version is now 20.19 +
- 6d35a38: refactor: To support credential response encryption, the `createCredentialResponse` now returns an object containing the `credentialResponse` parameter and optionally a `credentialResponseJwt`.
- 1a8372b: Parses and Verify grant types against grant_types_supported.
  This can cause issues if the authorization server does not have the
  correct grant_types_supported configured correctly.

### Patch Changes

- 4877518: fix: make an exception for openid4vci-proof+jwt jwt typ where iss value does not match the did in the jwt proof header
- 6d35a38: feat: add support for request & reponse encryption
- fa29ab6: feat: add support for Node 26
- ba93c72: feat: add support for the new Interactive Authorization Endpoint from OpenID4VCI 1.1 draft to allow presentation during issuance. NOTE: this feature is experimental and not stable in OpenID4VCI yet, it may be changed in this library in an incompatible way in a patch release.
- 3fb55be: Remove exp field from wallet attestation JWT payload schema
  Export CreateCredentialResponseOptions type
- 943be7d: fix: source credential response encryption `alg` from the JWK

  `credential_response_encryption` no longer requires a top-level `alg` (per OpenID4VCI V1 the key management algorithm is carried in `jwk.alg`), so parsing no longer fails when it is absent. The optional `zip` parameter was added. The response encryptor now sources `alg` from `jwk.alg`, falling back to a top-level `alg` for backwards compatibility with draft 14/15 wallets (where it was a required member).

- Updated dependencies [4fb7574]
  - @openid4vc/oauth2@0.4.5
  - @openid4vc/utils@0.4.5

## 0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- 0bf46b7: feat: add support for RFC 9207 OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Issuer Identification and add methods to the Oauth2Client and Openid4vciClient to parse and verify an authorization response. To meet HAIP requirements you should set `authorization_response_iss_parameter_supported` to true in your authorization server, and in the wallet you should use the new `Openid4vciClient.parseAndVerifyAuthorizationResponseRedirectUrl` to parse and verify the authorization response. The verification method only verifies against the authorization server metadata, while HAIP/FAPI require the value to ALWAYS be present. In the future a method will be added that verifies if the authorization server metadata is aligned with the requirements of HAIP. This way the verification methods can stay simpler, and verify based on the authorization server metadata.
- 3f3cfe7: fix: throw error in well known metadata retrieval if an error was thrown during first try
- 3f3cfe7: chore: better zod errors with more detail of nested errors

  - @openid4vc/oauth2@0.4.4

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- 9ca7372: fix(openid4vci): allow number/null for nested mdoc path values. This allows to access nested claims in arrays, after the namespace and element
- 5f901f0: fix: correctly transform the format identifiers vc+sd-jwt and dc+sd-jwt between different openid4vci (draft) versions
- 6bbe2ee: fix: allow both credential and credentials to be present in credential response. This enables integration with issuers that return both for backwards compatibility
- 5f901f0: chore: rename `OpenId4VciDraftVersion` to `OpenId4VciVersion`. `OpenId4VciDraftVersion` is deprecated, but has been kept for backwards compatibility
- 5f901f0: fix(openid4vci): transform claims between object and array between drafts
- 5f901f0: fix: transformation of credential issuer metadata to draft 11. An issue with the validation logic resulted in the v1 to draft 11 transformation logic to throw a validation error
  - @openid4vc/oauth2@0.4.3
  - @openid4vc/utils@0.4.3

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 05af867: fix: add fallback handling when fetch request fails for metadata requests which have multiple URLs to be tried. It's impossible to e.g. detect a CORS exception,
  so instead we try the other URLs in case of a fetch error, and only throw the error if all requests failed.

  This is supported for both fetching credential issuer metadata and authorization server metadata.

- Updated dependencies [05af867]
  - @openid4vc/utils@0.4.2
  - @openid4vc/oauth2@0.4.2

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 2ead756: fix(openid4vci): loosen type validation for `format` in credential request. Previously an error would be thrown if both `format` and `credential_configuration_id` were present. Some wallets use this to broaden compatibilty, so it makes sense to not throw on this
  - @openid4vc/oauth2@0.4.1
  - @openid4vc/utils@0.4.1

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- dfa7819: Remove support for the CommonJS/CJS syntax. Since React Native bundles your code, the update to ESM should not cause issues. In addition all latest minor releases of Node 20+ support requiring ESM modules. This means that even if you project is still a CommonJS project, it can now depend on ESM modules. For this reason oid4vc-ts is now fully an ESM module.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [dfa7819]
  - @openid4vc/oauth2@0.4.0
  - @openid4vc/utils@0.4.0

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 70b9740: Add support for OpenID4VCI draft 15. It also includes improved support for client (wallet) attestations, and better support for server side verification.

  Due to the changes between Draft 14 and Draft 15 and it's up to the caller of this library to handle the difference between the versions. Draft 11 is still supported based on Draft 14 syntax (and thus will be automatically converted).

- 6e9c839: feat: stricter type validation for credential_signing_alg_values_supported. Especially for `mso_mdoc` this will have impact as it will disallow the use of string identifiers, since the spec requires it to be COSE Algorithms (numbers)
- fccae5c: chore: update to zod 4. Although the public API has not changed, it does impact the error messages and some of the error structures
- 5d46285: Add support for W3C VCDM 2.0 SD-JWT format.
- 06db16a: feat: add support for JAR in pushed authorization requests.

  NOTE: the `parsePushedAuthorizationRequest` now optionally returns an `authorizationRequestJwt` parameter. You MUST pass this to the `verifyPushedAuthorizationResponse` method to ensure the JWT is verified.

- 5d46285: All types related to the legacy `vc+sd-jwt` format (now `dc+sd-jwt`) have been renamed and marked as deprecated:

  - `SdJwtVcFormatIdentifier` is now `LegacySdJwtVcFormatIdentifier`
  - `zSdJwtVcCredentialIssuerMetadataDraft14` is now `zLegacySdJwtVcCredentialIssuerMetadataDraft14`
  - `zSdJwtVcCredentialRequestFormatDraft14` is now `zLegacySdJwtVcCredentialRequestFormatDraft14`
  - `zSdJwtVcFormatIdentifier` is now `zLegacySdJwtVcFormatIdentifier`

  Please update your implementations to use the new `dc+sd-jwt` format.

- e206509: Add support for deferred credential issuance and Draft 16 of the OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance.
- 8c5a70e: feat: update draft 16 to v1.0. This only introduces one breaking change requiring a transaction_id in the deferred credential response. For this reason we replaced the Draft16 support with V1. All other drafts are still supported.
- 70b9740: fix typo in param from authorizationServerMetata to authorizationServerMetadata
- 78c1841: fix: loosen type validation to not error on issuer metadata that aligns with multiple draft versions
- 1b5e003: renamed oid4vci to openid4vci. This includes the package name, but also the class names and oid4vpRequestUrl to openid4vpRequestUrl
- 70b9740: replace the `dpopJwk` return value with `dpop` object with `jwk` key. It now also returns the `jwkThumbprint`
- 53c44bb: Fixes the credential issuer metadata, which is now correctly transformed to the syntax of Draft 16. In addition, some typing issues have also been fixed which prevented to get the types of nested fields.

  In addition, credential type-specific issuer metadata Zod types (e.g., `zMsoMdocCredentialIssuerMetadata`) now also match against the common credential configuration parameters.

- 26451d7: Before this PR, all packages used Valibot for data validation.
  We have now fully transitioned to Zod. This introduces obvious breaking changes for some packages that re-exported Valibot types or schemas for example.
- f798259: refactor: change the jwt signer method 'trustChain' to 'federation' and make 'trustChain' variable optional.
- 5bc407d: feat: do not break on invalid credential configurations that are not used for the current exchange. A new `knownCredentialConfigurationsSupported` is added to the issuer metadata result, which contain the valid credential configurations for known formats.

  Only a shallow validation is done when receiving the metadata, allowing metadata with some invalid configurations for format-specific properties to stil be used for issuing and requesting other credential configurations.

- eaad24f: feat(openid4vci): supported for creating, resolving and verifiying signed credential issuer metadata
- c23c86f: add support for sha-384, sha-512, rename SHA-256 to sha-256 to align with IANA hash algorithm names (<https://www.iana.org/assignments/named-information/named-information.xhtml>)

### Patch Changes

- 27a508c: feat(openid4vc): support the new issuer metadata url
- 5b69ca4: Fixes miscellaneous typos and adds code to the authorization request.
- e206509: Fix a myriad of typos across errors, comments, and variable names.
- c29dd5a: fix: entry file in package.json for cjs to point to the correct file extension
- ec552d7: support key-attestation+jwt in addition to keyattestation+jwt when verifying key attestation
- c8ce780: fix: path where oauth2 authorization server metadata is retrieved from.

  For OAuth you need to put `.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` between the origin and path (so `https://funke.animo.id/provider` becomes `https://funke.animo.id/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/provider`). We were putting the well known path after the full issuer url.

  It will now first check the correct path, and fall back to the invalid path.

- 404e1fe: Fixed the definition of the claims field in the issuer metadata for multiple draft versions.
- 158fa8c: feat: support node 22 and 24
- a28ceaa: The field `credentials` on the types `CredentialResponse` and `DeferredCredentialResponse` has been updated to correctly reflect the object structure present from Draft 15 and onwards of the OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance specification.
- 3b9b88a: fix: create fetch wrapper that always calls toString on URLSearchParams as React Native does not encode this correctly while Node.JS does
- 1ba4a59: Add support for parsing and verifying array 'aud' in JWTs.

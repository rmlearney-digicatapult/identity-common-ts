### Minor Changes

- 6e4a71b: Resolve `dc+sd-jwt` references as SD-JWT VC Type Metadata rather than as bare JSON Schema.
  
  `resolveSchemaReferences` now validates the resolved document against the new `TypeMetadataSchema`, cross-checks its `vct` against `meta.vct` from the catalogue entry, follows and merges the `extends` chain (verifying `extends#integrity` on each hop, with cycle detection and a `maxExtendsDepth` bound defaulting to 10), and resolves `schema_uri` as a second hop with `schema_uri#integrity` verified. The merged document is exposed as `ResolvedSchemaReference.typeMetadata`, and `parsedSchema` now holds the JSON Schema itself. References that are a plain JSON Schema remain supported.
  
  DCQL claims are taken verbatim from Type Metadata `claims[].path` when present, since Type Metadata already states every claim as a claims path pointer, and are inferred from the JSON Schema only as a fallback. The same claim set feeds `buildCredentialConfigurationTemplate`.
  
  Add an optional `issuanceProfile` to `SchemaMeta` describing the policy constraints a conformant issuer must satisfy, together with `buildCredentialConfigurationTemplate` and `validateIssuerMetadataAgainstProfile` for deriving and checking an OID4VCI `credential_configurations_supported` entry.
  
  **Breaking:** `verifyIntegrity` now defaults to `true`, and integrity is verified over the bytes as transferred. A `resolve` implementation must return the response body as a `string` or `Uint8Array`; returning already-parsed content throws unless `verifyIntegrity` is `false`. Previously the digest was computed over `JSON.stringify(content)` for parsed content, which does not match the transferred bytes.
  
  `version` is now validated as SemVer, the `x509Certificate` base64 pattern rejects lengths that are not a multiple of four, and the `integrity` pattern states that only `sha256` is supported.
- d055426: Align generated DCQL claims paths with the claims path pointer definition: a non-empty array of strings, `null`s and non-negative integers.
  
  Tuple-typed array schemas (a non-empty `prefixItems`, or the array form of `items`) now yield one claim per position addressed by its non-negative index, instead of a single path for the array field. A rest schema next to those positions (`items` alongside `prefixItems`, or `additionalItems`) is skipped, since a claims path pointer cannot address every index from a position onwards. The claims path types `DcqlClaim`, `DcqlClaimsPath` and `DcqlClaimsPathComponent` are exported.
  
  Fix claim extraction dropping a sub-schema that is shared between sibling properties by object identity, which can happen when a schema is resolved as an already-parsed object. Cycle detection is now scoped to the current branch instead of the whole traversal, so a shared sub-schema yields claims at every path it appears under.

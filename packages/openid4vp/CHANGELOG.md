## 0.5.6

### Patch Changes

- edfc2b5: Ignore the pre-draft-27 `authorization_encrypted_response_alg` and `authorization_encrypted_response_enc` client metadata parameters when the verifier also sends the 1.0 `encrypted_response_enc_values_supported`. Previously a verifier sending both generations of the response encryption metadata could fail with `Invalid authorization_encryption_enc`.
- edfc2b5: Move the `@openid4vc/*` packages from the `oid4vc-ts` repository into `identity-common-ts`. The `@openid4vc/*` packages keep being versioned together, separately from the other packages in this repository.
  
  The packages stay ESM-only. Type declarations are now exposed through the `types` export condition, and `main` points to the ESM build. `require('@openid4vc/oauth2')` loads the ESM build, which needs a Node.js version that supports `require(esm)` (Node.js 20.19 and later, or 22.12 and later).
  
  The builds no longer include copies of code from other `@openid4vc/*` packages. `@openid4vc/oauth2` bundled its own copy of `ValidationError`, so `instanceof ValidationError` checks against the class exported by `@openid4vc/utils` failed for some errors thrown by `@openid4vc/oauth2`. `@openid4vc/openid4vci` and `@openid4vc/openid4vp` bundled copies of `zOauth2ErrorResponse` and `addSecondsToDate`. `@openid4vc/oauth2` now exports the `VerifyClientAttestationOptions` type.

## 0.5.5

### Patch Changes

- 6060c2d: Add `getAuthorizationServerMetadata` and `getJwks` callbacks to the `CallbackContext`, allowing authorization server metadata and JWK Sets to be resolved without performing a request.
  
  This makes it possible to avoid network requests for metadata and keys that the caller already has (for example an authorization server hosted by the same application, which would otherwise result in an HTTP request to itself when verifying an access token it issued), and to serve metadata and keys from a cache.
  
  Both callbacks are optional. If not provided, or if they return `undefined`, the metadata and JWK Sets are fetched over HTTP as before. `getAuthorizationServerMetadata` can additionally return `null` to indicate the metadata definitively does not exist, so it is not requested again.
  
  Values returned by the callbacks are validated exactly like fetched values: a JWK Set is parsed with the JWK Set schema, and authorization server metadata is parsed with the authorization server metadata schema and must have an `issuer` matching the requested issuer.
  
  The second parameter of the exported `fetchJwks` and `fetchAuthorizationServerMetadata` functions now also accepts an object with `fetch` and the matching resolve callback, in addition to the `Fetch` implementation it accepted before.
- d9524be: Support parsing OpenID4VP Authorization Error Responses. When the wallet returns an authorization error response (e.g. it detected an error with the request, or is unavailable) instead of a successful response containing a `vp_token`, `parseOpenid4VpAuthorizationResponsePayload` (and `parseOpenid4vpAuthorizationResponse`) now throws an `Openid4vpAuthorizationResponseError` with the parsed `errorResponse`, instead of a confusing zod error about the missing `vp_token`.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 675b5b2: Pass allowedSkewInSeconds to verifyClientAttestation and verifyAttestationJWT functions, and deprecate clockSkewSec in favor of allowedSkewInSeconds for better naming consistency.
- fa29ab6: chore: drop node 18 support. Lowest supported Node.JS version is now 20.19 +
- ba93c72: it is now required to pass the `responseMode` object to the `resolveOpenid4vpAuthorizationRequest` method. The `responseMode` should contain a type indicating the expected response mode group (`direct_post`, `iae` or `dc_api`) along with response-mode specific parameters (e.g. `expectedOrigin`). This replaces the top-level `origin` parameter, and ensures only expected response modes are used within a context (since you are aware when calling the method whether you're in a DC/IAE or normal context).

### Patch Changes

- 6ebe36a: feat: use Oauth2ServerErrorResponseError for more errors for better error handling
- fa29ab6: feat: add support for Node 26
- ba93c72: fix: tigethened validation to disallow usage of `request_uri` in DC API request
- ba93c72: feat: add support for the new Interactive Authorization Endpoint from OpenID4VCI 1.1 draft to allow presentation during issuance. NOTE: this feature is experimental and not stable in OpenID4VCI yet, it may be changed in this library in an incompatible way in a patch release.
- 77339e2: fix: signed openid4vp requests without an `aud` field set now set the `aud` field to `https://self-issued.me/v2` according to OpenID4VP section 5.8

### Patch Changes

- @openid4vc/oauth2@0.4.1

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- dfa7819: Remove support for the CommonJS/CJS syntax. Since React Native bundles your code, the update to ESM should not cause issues. In addition all latest minor releases of Node 20+ support requiring ESM modules. This means that even if you project is still a CommonJS project, it can now depend on ESM modules. For this reason oid4vc-ts is now fully an ESM module.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [dfa7819]
  - @openid4vc/oauth2@0.4.0
  - @openid4vc/utils@0.4.0

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- edd7464: update the parsed dcql vp_token presentation result to always return an array of presentations
- 7904088: feat: support multi-presentation submission for transaction data (dcql multiple feature)
- 16e5b1c: feat: add support for `x509_hash` client id scheme.

  With support for this new client id scheme the `hash` callback is now required in the `Openid4vpClient`, and the `validateOpenid4vpClientId` method is now asynchronous.

- 1b5e003: feat: initial version of openid4vp
- fccae5c: chore: update to zod 4. Although the public API has not changed, it does impact the error messages and some of the error structures
- 06c016f: apu and apv in JWE encryptor are now base64 encoded values, to align with JOSE
- 06db16a: feat: add support for JAR in pushed authorization requests.

  NOTE: the `parsePushedAuthorizationRequest` now optionally returns an `authorizationRequestJwt` parameter. You MUST pass this to the `verifyPushedAuthorizationResponse` method to ensure the JWT is verified.

- 16e5b1c: refactor: client id scheme to client id prefix.

  All parameters have been changed to use prefix, so .e.g. `scheme` has become `prefix`. Only the parameters referring to the legacy separate `client_id_scheme` are still called scheme.

- 16e5b1c: feat: support the new `origin:` client id prefix in addition to `web-origin:` for the DC API.

  NOTE that for unsigned requests over the DC API, the `client_id` should be omitted, and you need to calculate the effective client id. Up to draft 25 this was `web-origin:<origin>` and after draft 25 it's `origin:<origin>`. It's not always possible to detect which prefix needs to be used, so if you're a verifier that wants to support both draft versions with the DC API, make sure to allow both prefixes for the session binding of presentations.

- 16e5b1c: add support for response encryption without leveraging JARM.

  Both the JARM-based response encryption, and the new OID4VP-based response encryption methods are supported. Both methods are used to determine which alg and enc values to use, and you should provide the same `jarm` configuration options. Once support for pre-1.0 drafts will be removed, the JARM options will also be replaced with a more OID4VP aligned API.

- 16e5b1c: feat: add support for draft 27 vp_formats_supported
- f798259: refactor: change the jwt signer method 'trustChain' to 'federation' and make 'trustChain' variable optional.
- 16e5b1c: feat: add support for the new `decentralized_identifier` and `openid_federation` client id schemes.

  The client information is also updated to return the `decentralized_identifier` and `openid_federation` scheme. The `effective` client is the value that should be used for comparison.

- edd7464: feat: update openid4vp to 1.0 final.

  The `version` returned in the `resolveOpenid4vpAuthorizationRequest` now returns `100` instead of `29` for the 1.0 final version of OpenID4VP.

# @sd-jwt/core

## 0.21.2

### Patch Changes

- 1cd910e: Scope `expectedIssuer`, `expectedSubject`, `expectedVct`, and `maxAgeSeconds` to the issuer-signed SD-JWT payload rather than applying them to the Key Binding JWT or Status List Token. Credential `expectedAudience` and `allowedIssuerAlgorithms` no longer constrain the Key Binding JWT. Use `expectedKeyBindingAudience` to constrain the Key Binding JWT's audience. Issuer algorithm restrictions no longer constrain the Status List Token and its signature remains verified by the configured status verifier.
- @owf/identity-common@0.4.2

## 0.21.1

### Patch Changes

- 833bfbc: Fix nested disclosure value mutation during `unpack` by cloning disclosure values before recursive unpacking.
- a7b5b83: Propagate `ExtendedPayload` generic through `SDJwtInstance.decode`, `keys`, `presentableKeys`, and `getClaims`.
  Add standard RFC 7519 `aud` and `jti` claims to `SdJwtVcPayload`.
- @owf/identity-common@0.4.1

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- 65a7173: Move `@sd-jwt/core` and `@sd-jwt/sd-jwt-vc` from the `sd-jwt-js` repository into `identity-common-ts`. The `@sd-jwt/*` packages keep their own version line, separate from `@owf/*`.
  
  The packages are now built with `tsdown`, like the other packages in this repository. The CommonJS entrypoint is `dist/index.cjs` (was `dist/index.js`), type declarations are exposed through the `types` export condition, and `@owf/*` dependencies use a caret range (`^`).

### Patch Changes

- 65a7173: Add `base64urlDecodeJson` to `@owf/identity-common`, and use it in `decodeJwt`. Bytes that are not valid UTF-8 are now rejected instead of being decoded to a different string, and invalid base64url, UTF-8 or JSON in a JWT header or payload all throw `IdentityCommonException('Invalid JWT as input')`, without exposing parser details.
  
  `@sd-jwt/core` now uses these functions from `@owf/identity-common` for decoding JWTs and disclosures, instead of its own implementation. Errors are still thrown as `SDJWTException` with the same messages.

# @openid4vc/utils

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 1beaa04: Normalize the `htu` claim of a DPoP proof the same way as the request URL before comparing them, so query and fragment are ignored (RFC 9449 §4.3) and an uppercase host or explicit default port no longer cause a mismatch (RFC 3986 §6.2.2, §6.2.3). `zHttpsUrl` now accepts the URL scheme case-insensitively (RFC 3986 §3.1).

## 0.6.0

### Patch Changes

- 18f267c: Omit absent `error`, `error_description` and `scope` parameters from the `WWW-Authenticate` header produced by `Oauth2ResourceUnauthorizedError.toHeaderValue()`. Previously they were emitted as bare parameter names (e.g. `Bearer error, error_description, scope`), which is not a valid challenge per RFC 9110 §11.6.1. `encodeWwwAuthenticateHeader` now skips payload entries with an `undefined` value, while `null` values are still encoded as bare parameter names.

## 0.5.6

### Patch Changes

- edfc2b5: Move the `@openid4vc/*` packages from the `oid4vc-ts` repository into `identity-common-ts`. The `@openid4vc/*` packages keep being versioned together, separately from the other packages in this repository.
  
  The packages stay ESM-only. Type declarations are now exposed through the `types` export condition, and `main` points to the ESM build. `require('@openid4vc/oauth2')` loads the ESM build, which needs a Node.js version that supports `require(esm)` (Node.js 20.19 and later, or 22.12 and later).
  
  The builds no longer include copies of code from other `@openid4vc/*` packages. `@openid4vc/oauth2` bundled its own copy of `ValidationError`, so `instanceof ValidationError` checks against the class exported by `@openid4vc/utils` failed for some errors thrown by `@openid4vc/oauth2`. `@openid4vc/openid4vci` and `@openid4vc/openid4vp` bundled copies of `zOauth2ErrorResponse` and `addSecondsToDate`. `@openid4vc/oauth2` now exports the `VerifyClientAttestationOptions` type.

### Minor Changes

- fa29ab6: chore: drop node 18 support. Lowest supported Node.JS version is now 20.19 +

### Patch Changes

## 0.4.5

### Patch Changes

- 9c0ac58: fix: allow non-integer (decimal) numbers for JWT claims (iat/nbf/exp)

## 0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- 3f3cfe7: chore: better zod errors with more detail of nested errors

## 0.4.3

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 05af867: fix: add fallback handling when fetch request fails for metadata requests which have multiple URLs to be tried. It's impossible to e.g. detect a CORS exception,
  so instead we try the other URLs in case of a fetch error, and only throw the error if all requests failed.

  This is supported for both fetching credential issuer metadata and authorization server metadata.

## 0.4.1

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- dfa7819: Remove support for the CommonJS/CJS syntax. Since React Native bundles your code, the update to ESM should not cause issues. In addition all latest minor releases of Node 20+ support requiring ESM modules. This means that even if you project is still a CommonJS project, it can now depend on ESM modules. For this reason oid4vc-ts is now fully an ESM module.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 70b9740: Add support for OpenID4VCI draft 15. It also includes improved support for client (wallet) attestations, and better support for server side verification.

  Due to the changes between Draft 14 and Draft 15 and it's up to the caller of this library to handle the difference between the versions. Draft 11 is still supported based on Draft 14 syntax (and thus will be automatically converted).

- fccae5c: chore: update to zod 4. Although the public API has not changed, it does impact the error messages and some of the error structures
- 70b9740: fix typo in param from authorizationServerMetata to authorizationServerMetadata
- 26451d7: Before this PR, all packages used Valibot for data validation.
  We have now fully transitioned to Zod. This introduces obvious breaking changes for some packages that re-exported Valibot types or schemas for example.

### Patch Changes

- c29dd5a: fix: entry file in package.json for cjs to point to the correct file extension
- 158fa8c: feat: support node 22 and 24
- 3b9b88a: fix: create fetch wrapper that always calls toString on URLSearchParams as React Native does not encode this correctly while Node.JS does
